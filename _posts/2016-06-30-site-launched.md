Hi there.

I'm keeping these fairly unorganized blog posts with hopes that I can organize my mind and experiences by blogging and that maybe someone, somewhere might find something useful. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to create this blog. To quote the developers, "Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free." You need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) to run Jekyll, along with GCC and Make.

The blog posts are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
