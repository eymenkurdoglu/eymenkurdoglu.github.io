Hierarchical-P coding structure, which I will abbreviate as hP, is a frame referencing structure that leads to 
temporal layering of the encoded video stream with **only** the P-frames. Since no B-frames are used, the decoding 
order of the frames is the same as their display order; that is, there is no additional delay caused by 
display-decoding order mismatch. This makes hP the de facto temporal layering method for low-delay video call 
applications. Despite this fact, there is not much to be found online about hP except for a couple of papers, 
let alone an open-source hP-capable video encoder.

So, can we modify the powerful open-source encoder x264 to produce hP-coded video? In order to find out, we need to
 understand the reference frame (or picture) management in H.264/AVC standard, and then they way it is implemented 
 in x264. I know, I know, dealing with any kind of industrial standard is painful (ugh), especially the video coding 
 standards. So here are two amazing books by Iain Richardson to help us understand the concepts in the standard:

* [H.264 and MPEG-4 Video Compression](http://www.amazon.com/H-264-MPEG-4-Video-Compression-Next-generation-ebook/dp/B000PY4VS8/ref=sr_1_5)
* [H.264 Advanced Video Compression Standard](http://www.amazon.com/H-264-Advanced-Video-Compression-Standard/dp/0470516925/ref=sr_1_2)

There are two key questions we will answer:

1. How does the decoder know which decoded picture should be kept around?
2. How does it know which frame is to be used as a reference to decode the current frame?

## Basics of Reference Picture Management

When a picture is encoded and reconstructed (in the encoder) or decoded (in the decoder), it is placed in the **decoded picture buffer** and is marked either as 

* **unused for reference** (and hence not used for any further prediction)
* a **short-term picture**
* a **long-term picture**.

For a P-slice, the default order of short-term pictures in list0 is in descending `PicNum = frame_num%MaxFrameNum`. For a B-slice, the default order of short-term pictures in list0 (list1) is descending  (ascending) POC for earlier (later) pictures, and then ascending (descending) POC for later (earlier) pictures. As each new picture is added to 
the short term list at position 0, the indices of the remaining short-term pictures are incremented. If the number 
of short-term and long-term pictures is equal to the maximum number of reference frames, the oldest short-term 
picture is removed from the buffer, which is known as **sliding window memory control**. The effect is that the encoder 
and decoder each maintain a window of reference pictures. **Adaptive memory control** commands, that can be sent by the 
encoder, manage the short and long-term picture indices. Using these commands, a short-term picture may be assigned 
a long-term frame index, or any reference picture may be marked as unused for reference.

The encoder chooses a reference picture from list0 for encoding each MB partition in an inter-coded MB. The choice 
of the reference picture is signaled by an index number, where index 0 corresponds to the first frame in the short-term 
section, and the indices of the long-term frames start after the last short-term frame.

## Reference Pictures List Syntax in H.264

Okay, let us look at how we can signal the modifications in the reference picture lists, if any, to the decoder. We will use specific fields of the slice headers for this job.

### Changing the number of active reference pictures

When set, the flag called <code>num_ref_idx_active_override_flag</code> 
 in the slice header signals overwriting the <code>num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1</code> and <code>num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1</code> 
 values in the PPS for the current slice (and only for the current slice) with the corresponding values in the slice header. 
 The end result is that, at the decoder side, all entries of the reference lists past the corresponding positions are ignored.

### Changing the order of the reference pictures in the list

<<<<<<< HEAD
When set, the flag called <code>ref_pic_list_reordering_flag_l0</code> signals reordering the list0. This is done through the fields <code>reordering_of_pic_nums_idc</code> and <code>abs_diff_pic_num_minus1</code> 
following this flag. Basically, these fields specify which of the reference pictures are reordered. When such a syntax pair is parsed, the decoder puts the picture with <code>PicNum = predictedPicNum Â± (abs_diff_pic_num_minus1+1)</code> to the corresponding place in the list0, starting from the head of the list. For the very first reordering operation, <code>predictedPicNum</code> is the same as <code>PicNum</code> of the current picture, while for the subsequent operations, it is the <code>PicNum</code> of the last reordered picture.
 
 Obviously, the number of the reorderings cannot exceed `num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1+1`.
  
### Marking the decoded reference pictures 

Finally, we can mark a reference picture as *short-term*, *long-term* or *unused* by setting the `adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag` field in the slice header. Otherwise, the decoder falls back to the default sliding window reference picture marking mode.  

 

## How does x264 do it?

* In <code>x264_slice_init</code> function, the number of active reference frames for the current slice are determined simply by <code>h->sh.i_num_ref_idx_l0_active = h->i_ref[0]</code>. 
* If <code>h->sh.i_num_ref_idx_l0_active != h->pps->i_num_ref_idx_l0_default_active</code>, then <code>h->sh.b_num_ref_idx_override</code> is set. It is then written onto the byte-stream in the <code>x264_slice_header_write</code> function.
* In <code>x264_reference_check_reorder</code> function, in case of a P-slice (check <code>h->sh.i_type</code>), <code>frame_num</code> values of the frames in list0 are checked to see if they are descending. Otherwise, we set <code>h->b_ref_reorder[list] = 1</code>.
=======
Sometimes we might want to reorder the reference frame list just for a particular slice. When such a change is made, the flag `ref_pic_list_reordering_flag_l0` in the slice header needs to be set to notify the decoder that there is a change. This is followed by inserting a pair of values for `reordering_of_pic_nums_idc` and `abs_diff_pic_num_minus1` fields for each reordering we have. 

Basically, n<sup>th</sup> such syntax pair signals the `frame_num` offset of the reference frame that will be placed n<sup>th</sup> in the list. The absolute value of the offset is given by `abs_diff_pic_num_minus1+1`, while the sign is determined by `reordering_of_pic_nums_idc`. Then the frame, for which `frame_num = last_reordered_frame_num + offset`, is put in the n<sup>th</sup> place in the list, while the rest is shifted. The initial value of the `last_reordered_frame_num` is the `frame_num` of the slice, and it is updated with each reordering. Obviously, the number of the reorderings cannot exceed `num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1+1`.
