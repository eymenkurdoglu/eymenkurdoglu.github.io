Hierarchical-P coding structure, which I will abbreviate as hP, is a frame referencing structure that leads to temporal layering of the encoded video stream with **only** the P-frames. Since no B-frames are used, the decoding order of the frames is the same as their display order; that is, there is no additional delay caused by display-decoding order mismatch. This makes hP the de facto temporal layering method for low-delay video call applications. Despite this fact, there is not much to be found online about hP except for a couple of papers, let alone an open-source hP-capable video encoder.
