As of now, libx264 is the fastest and the most bitrate efficient open-source H.264 encoder library. But it has no good documentation out there for beginners like me. So, in this post, I will try to explain what is going on under the hood during the encoding. You can find the code in `encoder/encode.c` file under your default x264 folder.

In a broad sense, the encoder is abstracted into an `x264_t` struct, written in common/common.h, that holds the encoder state. Inside it, there are lots of sub-structs. Here is a few important issues, without any order. 

### Slice headers

Slices are initialized in `x264_slice_init()`. This is done by taking the values of the relevant variables in the encoder object `h` (of class `x264_t`) and copying them to the relevant variables in the slice header object `sh` (of class `x264_slice_header_t`) of `h`. The actual writing onto the byte-stream occurs in `x264_slice_header_write()`. Now let us focus on two of the slice header fields.

* The flag to override the default number of active reference frames and their new values are set _outside_ `x264_slice_header_init()` (check out the previous post to learn more about them). The numbers of reference frames in either list are held in `i_ref[2]` in `h`.

* The flag to override the default order of the reference frames and the new orderings are set _inside_ `x264_slice_header_init()`. The equivalent flag in `h`, `b_ref_reorder`, is typically set in one of the `x264_reference_*` functions called during the frame context setup. Check out the final code snippet - it is basically the algorithm mentioned in the previous post.

{% highlight c %}
int pred_frame_num = i_frame;
for( int i = 0; i < h->i_ref[list]; i++ ) {
 int diff = h->fref[list][i]->i_frame_num - pred_frame_num;
 sh->ref_pic_list_order[list][i].idc = ( diff > 0 );
 sh->ref_pic_list_order[list][i].arg = (abs(diff) - 1) & ((1 << sps->i_log2_max_frame_num) - 1);
 pred_frame_num = h->fref[list][i]->i_frame_num;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Reference lists

Final reference lists are created in `x264_reference_build_list()`, before encoding each frame, by simply copying the contents of `h->frames.reference` array into the appropriate `h->fref` reference list in `h`. Then both lists are [sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) with respect to the distance to the frame (closer reference frames have smaller indices), using the `i_frame` variable. The orders of the reference lists are double-checked in `x264_reference_check_reorder()`; if it is different from the standard's default, a reordering is signaled. Check out the code snippet below - according to the standard, list0 is ordered with respect to `frame_num` if we have a P-slice, while list0 and list1 are ordered with respect to `poc` in case of a B-slice. 

{% highlight c %}
for( int list = 0; list <= (h->sh.i_type == SLICE_TYPE_B); list++ ) {
    for( int i = 0; i < h->i_ref[list] - 1; i++ )
    {
        int framenum_diff = h->fref[list][i+1]->i_frame_num - h->fref[list][i]->i_frame_num;
        int poc_diff = h->fref[list][i+1]->i_poc - h->fref[list][i]->i_poc;
        /* P and B-frames use different default orders. */
        if( h->sh.i_type == SLICE_TYPE_P ? framenum_diff > 0 : list == 1 ? poc_diff < 0 : poc_diff > 0 )
        {
            h->b_ref_reorder[list] = 1;
            return;
        }
    }
}
