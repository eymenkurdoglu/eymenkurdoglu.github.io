As of now, libx264 is the fastest and the most bitrate efficient open-source H.264 encoder library. But it has no good documentation out there for beginners like me. So, in this post, I will try to explain what is going on under the hood during the encoding. You can find the code in `./encoder/encode.c` file under your default x264 folder.

In a broad sense, the encoder is abstracted into an `x264_t` struct (./common/common.h) that holds the encoder state. Inside it, there are lots of sub-structs. Here is a few important issues, without any order. 

* Slices are initialized in `x264_slice_init()`. The actual writing onto the byte-stream occurs in `x264_slice_header_write()`.
	* The flag to override the default number of active reference frames and their new values are set _outside_ `x264_slice_header_init()`. The numbers of reference frames in either list are held in `i_ref[2]` in `x264_t`.
	* The flag to override the default order of the reference frames and their new ordering are set _inside_ `x264_slice_header_init()`. `x264_t`'s equivalent flag, `b_ref_reorder`, is typically set in one of the `x264_reference_*` functions called during the frame context setup. Check out the final code snippet - it is basically the algorithm mentioned in the previous post.

{% highlight c %}
int pred_frame_num = i_frame;
for( int i = 0; i < h->i_ref[list]; i++ ) {
 int diff = h->fref[list][i]->i_frame_num - pred_frame_num;
 sh->ref_pic_list_order[list][i].idc = ( diff > 0 );
 sh->ref_pic_list_order[list][i].arg = (abs(diff) - 1) & ((1 << sps->i_log2_max_frame_num) - 1);
 pred_frame_num = h->fref[list][i]->i_frame_num;
}
{% endhighlight %}
