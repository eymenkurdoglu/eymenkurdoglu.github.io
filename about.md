# Hi :)

I recently got my Ph.D. degree from the [ECE Department](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/electrical) at [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](http://engineering.nyu.edu/).

Check out my advisors' pages: Prof. [Yao Wang](http://eeweb.poly.edu/~yao/) and Prof. [Yong Liu](http://eeweb.poly.edu/~yongliu/)

# Research

I like to think and work on communication systems and the mathematical tools commonly used to analyze them. In particular, video communications, P2P networks, video conferencing, etc. You can find detailed information on a specific project on my GitHub page.

# Bio

I received my B.Sc. degrees in [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](https://eee2.metu.edu.tr) and in [Physics](http://www.physics.metu.edu.tr) from [Middle East Technical University](http://www.metu.edu.tr), and then worked for a brief amount of time in [Tubitak Space Technologies Research Institute Research Center](http://uzay.tubitak.gov.tr/en) in Ankara, Turkey. That was followed by the M.Sc. studies in [Communication Systems](http://ic.epfl.ch/en) at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](http://www.epfl.ch/), which ended in 2010. I ultimately started my Ph.D. studies at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/) in January 2012.
